# Tests Submodule

This dedicated space serves as a sandbox for experimentation. It houses ongoing tests, scripts, and utilities that haven't been integrated into the main pipeline yet. Whether you're working on a new hypothesis, crafting a detailed Jupyter notebook, or just testing out modifications, this submodule is your playground. This directory also serves a place unit tests in scripts written using the Python `unittest` module.
