# Training Submodule

This submodule contains code for training and evaluating neural network models for neural data analysis.

## File Structure

The submodule consists of the following files:

- `_pkg.py`: Contains the main imports and configurations used in the training package.
- `_utils.py`: Contains utility functions for training and evaluating neural network models.
- `_main.py`: Provides functions to load and preprocess data for training and evaluation.

This submodule uses the `data` and `models` submodules for loading the data and defining models.

## Usage

To use the training submodule, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python dependencies as explained in the `setup` folder.
2. Modify the configuration file `conf/train.yaml` to specify the training parameters.
3. Take a look into the `data` and `models` submodules for dataset and model configuration.
4. Run the `_main.py` script to start the training process using the specified configuration.

Note: Ensure that the dataset files are available in the specified locations and that the model configuration is compatible with the dataset.

## Data Loading and Model Configuration

The `data` directory contains modules for loading the data. These modules provide functions to transform raw data into a format suitable for training and evaluation. You can choose the dataset to be used for training by editing the `conf/dataset.yaml` file.

The `models` directory contains modules for defining and configuring models. These modules provide functions to create and configure neural network models based on the specified model type and parameters. You can modify the model's hyperparameters by editing the `conf/models.yaml` file. For model customization and creation, take a look at the submodule itself.

## Training and Evaluation

The `_utils.py` module contains utility functions for training and evaluating neural network models. It includes functions for splitting data into train and test sets, optimizing models, and computing loss metrics. You can modify these functions to incorporate custom training or evaluation logic.

## Customization

The training submodule is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify the configuration file, data preprocessing modules, model configuration modules, and utility functions to adapt the training process to your specific needs.

Feel free to explore the code in each file for a more detailed understanding of the implementation and customization options.
